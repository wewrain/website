<p>Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 British-American war film directed and produced 
by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford 
was based on Hasford&#39;s novel The Short-Timers (1979). Its storyline follows a 
platoon of U.S. Marines through their training, primarily focusing on two 
privates, Joker and Pyle, who struggle to get through camp under their 
foul-mouthed drill instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, and the experiences of 
two of the platoon&#39;s Marines in the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War. The 
film&#39;s title refers to the full metal jacket bullet used by soldiers. The film 
was released in the United States on June 26, 1987. </p>
<p>Full Metal Jacket received critical acclaim and an Academy Award nomination 
for Best Adapted Screenplay for Kubrick, Herr, and Hasford. In 2001, the 
American Film Institute placed it at No. 95 in their &quot;AFI&#39;s 100 Years...100 
Thrills&quot; poll.</p>
